**Overall Architecture:**

Your application follows a **modern, server-centric architecture**, leveraging the capabilities of Next.js 13's `app` directory, Server Components, and Client Components. You're using Firebase for your backend services, and React Query for optimized client-side state management. 

**Key Technologies and Patterns:**

1. **Next.js App Router:**  
   - **Server Components:**  Handle data fetching, authentication, and other server-side logic. 
   - **Client Components:**  Handle user interactions, UI updates, and client-side state. 
   - **File-Based Routing:**  Routes are defined by the file structure in the `app` directory.

2. **Firebase:**
   - **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (with Google Sign-In) provides user authentication and secure access to your backend. 
   - **Firestore:**  Your primary database for storing and managing data. 
   - **Storage:** Firebase Storage for handling file uploads and downloads. 
   - **Admin SDK (Server-Side):**  Used in Server Components and API routes to interact with Firebase securely.
   - **Web SDK (Client-Side):**  Used in Client Components for user interactions and limited Firebase operations.

3. **React Query:** 
   - **Server-State Management:**  React Query optimizes data fetching and caching, minimizing calls to Firebase and enhancing the user experience.
   - **`useQuery`:** Used in Client Components to fetch data from API routes. 
   - **`useMutation`:**  Handles data updates and interactions with API routes that modify data in Firebase.

4. **NextAuth.js (Optional):**
   - You can use NextAuth.js to simplify the integration of Firebase Authentication with Next.js and get additional features like session management. 

**Data Flow:**

1. **Client Component:** A Client Component (e.g., an events list) uses `useQuery` to fetch data. 
2. **API Route:**  `useQuery`'s `queryFn` makes a request to a Next.js API route.
3. **Firebase (Server-Side):** The API route uses the Firebase Admin SDK to fetch data from Firestore (or other Firebase services). 
4. **Response:**  The API route returns a JSON response to the Client Component.
5. **React Query Cache:** React Query caches the data on the client-side, reducing future requests to Firebase.

**Authentication and Authorization:**

- **Authentication:**  Users authenticate with Google Sign-In using the Firebase Web SDK. 
- **ID Tokens:** The client receives an ID token, which is used to authenticate requests to API routes.
- **API Route Verification:**  API routes use the Firebase Admin SDK to verify ID tokens, ensuring secure access to Firebase.
- **Custom Claims:** You can add custom claims to user tokens using the Firebase Admin SDK for role-based authorization (e.g., `role: admin`). 
- **Firestore Security Rules:** Firestore rules enforce data access based on user authentication and custom claims.

**Additional Points:**

- **Zustand for Client-State:** You're likely using Zustand to manage global client-side state, such as user preferences or UI settings.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in both Client Components and API routes to manage unexpected situations.
